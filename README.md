jQuery-Knob-Countdown
=====================
* A simple, amazing jQuery countdown timer, visualized with jQuery Knob (aterrien/jQuery-Knob). Dates can be supplied in "DD-MON-YEAR-TIME" format (like "19 April 2013 16:24:00").
* The plugin is modular, and can be adapted to fit almost any needs.
* Lightweight & fast
* Incredibly accurate
* Cookie / Session free (harder to break, no problems with clearing cache)
* Can be easily used to trigger a server-side event, for example, to execute a function when the countdown reaches zero.
